# Comms

Hello All,

I'm ready and hope you are. Doors open for our hands-on workshop on Friday at 9:00 at 1 Memorial Drive Cambridge (Microsoft NERD building). 

In the morning we will provide coffee and tea (thanks to Cloud Construct, our sponsor). 

In the afternoon we will provide lunch (sandwiches, pizza, some with meat, some without meat). If you have more exotic food requirements please be warned in case you wish to pack a lunch.

Government-issued ID is required to enter the building. This is enforced by facility security team at the ground floor. 

Please see meetup page for parking and other important details - including having VS Code and .NET 9 running on your laptop ahead of the event!

This is a sold-out event. If you are NOT going to make it please update your attendance so we can let someone else have your spot.

See you Friday! 

Best,

Bill on behalf of the Boston Azure AI team
