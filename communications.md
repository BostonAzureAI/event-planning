# Comms

Hello All,

I'm ready and hope you are. Doors open for [our hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazureai/events/305679069/) on Friday at 9:00 at 1 Memorial Drive Cambridge (Microsoft NERD building).

Government-issued ID is required to enter the building. This is enforced on entry by building security.

Thanks to our sponsor [Cloud Construct](https://cloudconstruct.com), in the morning we will provide coffee and tea and in the afternoon we will provide lunch (though with limited options).  For lunch we plan on sandwiches and pizza, some with meat and some without. If you have specific food requirements please be warned in case you wish to pack a lunch.

Remember to have VS Code and .NET 9 running on your laptop ahead of the event!

This is a sold-out event. If you are NOT going to make it please update your attendance so we can let someone else have your spot.

Please see the [Meetup event page](https://www.meetup.com/bostonazureai/events/305679069) for parking and other important details. (Most people park under the building which costs $29/day weekdays.)

See you Friday!

Best regards,

Bill on behalf of Jason and the rest of the Boston Azure AI team
